# TodoPwa

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Branches

Each branch contains a different example of how you might take a PWA and deploy it to the app stores. A short description of the approach used in each is listed below:
* master - Contains the original PWA with no modifications.
* Ionic - A new ionic application was started with `ionic start TodoPwa blank --type=angular`. The components used in the original application where copied over with no changes.
* Ionic2 - A new ionic application was started with `ionic start TodoPwa blank --type=angular` and the application was re-implemented using the Ionic Framework instead of Angular Material.
* PwaBuilder - An android application was created using [PwaBuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) to show the PWA in an application.
* TWA - An android application was created to show the PWA using a TWA (Trusted Web Activity). For more information see https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/using-twa
